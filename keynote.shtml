  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Since 2007, high performance computing has been at the beginnings of <br>
  the most dramatic change in form and function in the last decade and a half. Since <br>
  the advent of the killer micro and the MPPs and commodity Clusters it spawned <br>
  supported by message-passing programming techniques, most notably MPI, HPC <br>
  has been on an exponential curve augmenting performance at historic rates through <br>
  incremental changes to feature size, clock rate, and architectural complexity. But <br>
  as always happens with S-curves, HPC is turning towards its final asymptote and <br>
  is undergoing what may prove to be its 6th and potential final phase change. Most <br>
  visible is the adoption of multicore heterogeneous system architectures driven by <br>
  constraints in power, complexity, clock rate, and reliability while continuing to <br>
  exploit improvements in feature size to achieve growth in performance. To realize <br>
  this goal and the achievement of Exascale performance by the end of the next decade <br>
  within practical limitations critical advances in efficiency, scalability, energy, and<br>
  programmability will be required. In all previous such metamorphoses in HPC, the <br>
  underlying principles of a new execution model was used to guide the co-design of <br>
  new architectures, programming methods, and system software. Such is the case for <br>
  the emerging HPC Phase VI. This presentation will discuss the likely elements the <br>
  new execution model based on the exploratory ParalleX model of computation, and <br>
  describe key attributes of architecture, operating, and runtime system software, and <br>
  programming methods that are likely to gain ascendency over the next decade. <br>
  Results from recent experiments with HPX prototype runtime system will be presented. </p>

  <h4 class="style3">Keynote II: The Polytope Model, Past, Present, Future</h4>
  <p><strong>Paul Feautrier</strong><br>
    Professor<br>
  Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon, France</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The polytope model resulted, around 1990, of the conjunction of the<br>
    Systolic Array Design community and the Automatic Parallelization<br>
    community. At the time, both communities where toying with program<br>
    transformations, and it was soon realized that applying transformations<br>
    at the abstract level of the Iteration Space was much easier than<br>
    transforming the program text. Since then, the model has been applied<br>
    to scheduling, vectorization, distribution, and memory and locality<br>
  optimization.</p>
  <p>The model has two drawbacks: the severe restrictions it imposes on<br>
    the source program, and its lack of scalability. I will sketch<br>
    some research directions toward the resolution of these difficulties.</p>
