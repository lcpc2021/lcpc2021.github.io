<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The commercialization of autonomous machines is a thriving sector, and likely to be the next major computing demand driver, after PC, cloud computing, and mobile computing. Nevertheless, a suitable computing system, along with a powerful compiler, for autonomous machines are missing, and many companies are forced to develop ad hoc computing solutions that are neither scalable nor extensible. </p>
<p>In this talk, we share our experiences of building computing systems for autonomous machines, including on-machine computing systems, cloud computing systems, and cooperative autonomous machine computing systems (e.g. multi robots).  Based on these case studies, we summarize our key findings and explore how compilers can help guarantee the real-time performance, reliability, safety, and security of autonomous machines. </p>
