<p><strong>Shaoshan Liu</strong>, Founder and CEO of PerceptIn Inc</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The commercialization of autonomous machines is a thriving sector, and likely to be the next major computing demand driver, after PC, cloud computing, and mobile computing. Nevertheless, a suitable computing system, along with a powerful compiler, for autonomous machines are missing, and many companies are forced to develop ad hoc computing solutions that are neither scalable nor extensible. </p>
<p>In this talk, we share our experiences of building computing systems for autonomous machines, including on-machine computing systems, cloud computing systems, and cooperative autonomous machine computing systems (e.g. multi robots).  Based on these case studies, we summarize our key findings and explore how compilers can help guarantee the real-time performance, reliability, safety, and security of autonomous machines. </p>

<p><strong>Sarita Adve</strong>, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The end of Dennard scaling and Moore's law is leading to domain-specific heterogeneous systems. There is an accompanying explosion of applications deployed on heterogeneous edge devices that interface directly with the end-user. Realizing the full potential of these trends requires changing how we conduct systems research.

To drive the technologies to enable domain-specific edge systems of 2030, my group has been working in the domain of extended reality (XR), including virtual and augmented reality. XR has the potential to transform our lives, but there is an orders of magnitude performance-power-quality gap between what is achievable today and our ideal XR systems.

We recently released ILLIXR –- Illinois Extended Reality tested –- the first open source XR system and testbed for XR systems research. Building ILLIXR has taught us that the systems of 2030 require researchers to learn how to do application-driven, end-to-end quality-of-experience driven, and hardware-software-application co-designed systems research. This is hard, but fun. I will share the pain and the joy of doing such research and our results and implications for both XR and systems research.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker's Biography</strong></p>
<p>Sarita V. Adve is the Richard T. Cheng Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research interests span the system stack, ranging from hardware to applications. She co-developed the memory models for the C++ and Java programming languages based on her early work on data-race-free models. She is also known for her work on heterogeneous systems and software-driven approaches for hardware resiliency. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the ACM and IEEE, and a recipient of the ACM/IEEE-CS Ken Kennedy award, the Anita Borg Institute Women of Vision award in innovation, the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes award, and the University of Illinois campus award for excellence in graduate student mentoring. As ACM SIGARCH chair, she co-founded the CARES movement, winner of the CRA distinguished service award, to address discrimination and harassment in Computer Science research events. She received her PhD from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her B.Tech. from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.</p>

  <h3 class="style3" id="invited1"><strong>Invited Talk 1: Separating Parallel Performance Concerns Using Chapel</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Michelle Mills Strout</strong>, University of Arizona and HPE </p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of separating concerns is a noble one that is often discussed, but is not being achieved with cross-cutting concerns like performance.  Optimizing performance usually requires selecting data and computation organizations to suit a particular architecture.  In the context of scientists and engineers who are writing simulation and data analysis codes, the performance concern impacts how quickly they can make scientific progress.  They have to leverage ever-changing and complex computer architectures to handle the sheer volume of data they produce and consume.  Thus, they find themselves rewriting portions of their code at a low level to obtain needed performance on new machines.

To empower programmers to make decisions about implementation details at a higher level, we need a programming system that cleanly separates WHAT the code is trying to do, from HOW it should accomplish it in terms of data and computation organization.  In this talk, I show how the Chapel parallel programming language achieves this clean separation by enabling multiresolution programming.  As an example of Chapel's multiresolution features in action, I will describe recent progress and performance in targeting GPUs with Chapel.</p>

<p><strong>Speaker's Biography</strong></p>
<p>Michelle Strout's main research area is high performance computing and her research interests include compilers and run-time systems, scientific computing, and software engineering. She earned her Ph.D. at the University of California, San Diego in 2003 with Jeanne Ferrante and Larry Carter as co-advisors. In 2008, Michelle received a CAREER Award from the National Science Foundation for her research in parallelization techniques for irregular applications, such as molecular dynamics simulations. In 2010, she received a DOE Early Career award to fund her research in separating the specification of scientific computing applications from the specification of implementation details such as how to parallelize such computations. Some of Prof. Strout's research contributions include the Universal Occupancy Vector (UOV) for determining storage mappings for any legal schedule in a stencil computation, the Sparse Polyhedral Framework (SPF) for specifying inspector-executor loop transformations, dataflow analysis for MPI programs, parameterized and full versus partial tiling with the outset and insets, and loop chaining for scheduling across stencil loops. </p>

<p><strong>Zhijia Zhao</strong>, UC Riverside</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>Finite-State Machine (FSM) is a basic computation model that is widely used for many applications. However, due to the inherent dependences among state transitions, it is very challenging to parallelize FSM-based computations. In this talk, I will present the basic techniques for parallelizing FSM-based computations, including both enumerative parallelization and speculative parallelization. Then, I will introduce a class of computations - bitstream computations, which rely on bitwise operations (e.g., AND, SHIFT, and XOR) to process long bit sequences. Though they appear totally different from the FSM applications, we find it is possible to convert them into FSM computations. In this talk, I will demonstrate this possibility with the help of a series of program analyses and dependence modeling techniques. </p>

<p><strong>Speaker's Biography</strong></p>
<p>Zhijia Zhao is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UC Riverside. He obtained his Ph.D. degree from the College of William and Mary in 2015. His research interests are in the areas of program optimizations, parallel computing, graph processing, and the reliability of event-based applications (e.g., Android apps). In particular, he is interested in applying program optimization techniques to data analytics for improving the performance and scalability. He is a recipient of NSF CAREER Award (2018), Regents Faculty Fellowship (2018), Hellman Fellowship (2018), Best Paper Runner-up Award at MobiSys'18, and Best Paper Award at ASPLOS'20.</p>
